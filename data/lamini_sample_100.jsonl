We forecast the penetration rate for 5G smartphone of the total smartphone market to rise from 18% in 2020 to more than 35% in 2021.\nWe expect the silicon content of a 5G smartphone to continue to increase as compared to a 4G smartphone. We continue to expect faster penetration of 5G smartphone as compared to 4G over the next several years as 5G smartphone benefit from the significant performance and with a latency improvement of 5G network to drive more AI applications and more cloud services. We believe 5G is a multi-year megatrend that will enable a world where digital computation is increasingly ubiquitous, which will fuel the growth of all four of our growth platforms in the next several years.\nAs we enter the 5G era, a smarter and more intelligent world will require massive increases in computation power and greater need for energy-efficient computing, and therefore, require leading-edge technologies. Thus, HPC is an increasingly important driver of TSMC's long-term growth and the largest contributor in terms of our incremental revenue growth. With our technology leadership, we are well positioned to capture the growth from the favorable industry megatrend. We now expect our long-term revenue growth to be 10% to 15% CAGR from 2020 to 2025 in US dollar terms.\nNow, I will talk about the N3 status. N3 will be another full node stride from our N5 with up to 70% logic density gain, up to 15% performance gain and up to 30% power reduction as compared with 5-nanometer. Our N3 technology will use FinFET transistor structure to deliver the best technology maturity, performance and cost for our customers. Our N3 technology development is on track with good progress. We are seeing a much higher level of customer engagement for both HPC and smartphone application at N3 as compared with N5 and N7 at a similar stage. Risk production is scheduled in 2021 and volume production is targeted in second half of 2022. Our 3-nanometer technology will be the most advanced foundry technology in both PPA and transistor technology when it is introduced. Thus, we are confident our 3-nanometer will be another large and long-lasting node for TSMC.\nFinally, I will talk about TSMC's 3D fabric. TSMC has developed an industry-leading and comprehensive wafer-level 3DIC technology roadmap to enhance system-level performance. Our differentiated chiplet and heterogeneous integration technologies drive better power efficiency, as smaller form factor benefit for our customer, while shortening their time to market. This technology, including CHIPS stake in solution, such as SoIC, as well as our advanced packaging solutions, such as InFO and CoWoS. We observe chiplets are becoming an industry trend. We are working with several customers on 3D fabric to enable chiplet architecture. SoIC's full volume production is targeted in 2022. SoIC is expected to be first adopted by HPC applications, where bandwidth performance, power efficiency and form factor are aggressively pursued. We expect revenue from our back-end services, which include InFO's advanced packaging and testing to grow at a rate higher than corporate average in the next few years.\nThis concluding our key message.

{"question": "What is TSMC's expected revenue growth rate in U.S. dollar terms over the next several years ", "answer": " The expected revenue growth rate for TSMC over the next several years is between 15% and 20% CAGR in U.S. dollar terms.", "transcript": "ferentiating factors, we expect our capacity utilization to remain healthy in 2023. And our business to be less volatile, they're more resilient, supported by the strong demand for our differentiated and leading advanced and specialty technologies.\nNow let me talk about TSMC's long-term growth outlook. While macroeconomic headwinds bring near-term uncertainties that may persist, we believe the fundamental structural growth trajectory in the long-term semiconductor demand remains firmly in place. We continue to observe silicon content increase across many end devices, fueled by process technology migration and increased functionality. For example, the number of CPUs, GPUs, and AI accelerators in the data center are increasing.\n5G smartphone carries substantially higher silicon content as compared to 4G smartphone. The amount of silicon content in today's car continue to rise. While the device unit growth of many electronics device may be flattish to low single-digit percentage range, in the next several years, the silicon content growth will be higher, in the mid- to high single-digit percentage range and support the long-term structural semiconductor demand and increase our addressable wafer demand. TSMC's capex and capacity planning are always based on the long-term structural market demand profile, not near-term factors.\nWe are working closely with our customer to plan our long-term capacity and investing in leading edge and specialty technology to support their growth. We will manage our business prudently through the near-term uncertainties, and we remain highly confident in our long-term growth outlook. With our technology leadership, manufacturing and capacity support and customers trust, TSMC is well positioned to capture the strong multiyear growth from the favorable structural megatrend of 5G and HPC-related applications and deliver profitable growth for our shareholders. We reiterate our long-term revenue to be between 15 and 20 CAGR over the next several years in U.S.\ndollar terms. Next, let me talk about the tool delivery update. As a major player in the global semiconductor supply chain, TSMC work closely with all our tool supplier to plan our capex and capacity in advance. However, like many other industries, our suppliers have been facing greater challenges in their supply chains, which are extending toward delivery lead times for both advanced and mature nodes.\nAs a result, we expect some of our capex this year to be pushed out into 2023. TSMC is actively doing its part to help our tool suppliers address the supply chain challenges. In April, we said that we have increased regular high-level communications to trace the progress and send several teams on site to support our suppliers. Since then, we have worked closely to identify critical chips that are gauging toward delivery.\nWe are working dynamically with our customers and prioritize our wafer capacity to support these critical chips to help mitigate the chip constant issues. While challenges remain, the situation is improving. We do not expect any impact to our 2022 capacity plan. And we are able to put in the delivery schedule for certain amount of tools for our 2023 capacity.\nWe have been working closely with our customer for 2023 so that we can support their demand. Now let me talk about the N3 and N3 status. Our N3 is on track for volume production in second half of this year with Goodyear. We expect revenue contribution starting first half of 2023, with a smooth ramp in 2023, driven by both HPC and smartphone applications.\nN3 will further extend our N3 family with the enhanced performance, power and yield. N3 will offer complete platform support for both smartphone and HPC applications. We observed a high level of customer engagement at N3. And volume production is scheduled for around one year after N3.\nOur 3-nanometer technology will be the most advanced semiconductor technology in both PPA and transistor technology when it is introduced.

We will manage our business prudently through the near-term uncertainties, and we remain highly confident in our long-term growth outlook. With our technology leadership, manufacturing and capacity support and customers trust, TSMC is well positioned to capture the strong multiyear growth from the favorable structural megatrend of 5G and HPC-related applications and deliver profitable growth for our shareholders. We reiterate our long-term revenue to be between 15 and 20 CAGR over the next several years in U.S.\ndollar terms. Next, let me talk about the tool delivery update. As a major player in the global semiconductor supply chain, TSMC work closely with all our tool supplier to plan our capex and capacity in advance. However, like many other industries, our suppliers have been facing greater challenges in their supply chains, which are extending toward delivery lead times for both advanced and mature nodes.\nAs a result, we expect some of our capex this year to be pushed out into 2023. TSMC is actively doing its part to help our tool suppliers address the supply chain challenges. In April, we said that we have increased regular high-level communications to trace the progress and send several teams on site to support our suppliers. Since then, we have worked closely to identify critical chips that are gauging toward delivery.\nWe are working dynamically with our customers and prioritize our wafer capacity to support these critical chips to help mitigate the chip constant issues. While challenges remain, the situation is improving. We do not expect any impact to our 2022 capacity plan. And we are able to put in the delivery schedule for certain amount of tools for our 2023 capacity.\nWe have been working closely with our customer for 2023 so that we can support their demand. Now let me talk about the N3 and N3 status. Our N3 is on track for volume production in second half of this year with Goodyear. We expect revenue contribution starting first half of 2023, with a smooth ramp in 2023, driven by both HPC and smartphone applications.\nN3 will further extend our N3 family with the enhanced performance, power and yield. N3 will offer complete platform support for both smartphone and HPC applications. We observed a high level of customer engagement at N3. And volume production is scheduled for around one year after N3.\nOur 3-nanometer technology will be the most advanced semiconductor technology in both PPA and transistor technology when it is introduced. Thus, we are confident that our N3 family will be another large and long-lasting node for TSMC.

Is that your perception?\nMary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer\nWell, go ahead, Giovanni.\nGiovanni Barbarossa -- Chief Strategy Officer and the President\nI'm sorry, you were talking about the 3D Sensing?\nMark Miller -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst\nYes. Typically, September is strongest, but some of that now might be shifting more into December than traditionally?\nGiovanni Barbarossa -- Chief Strategy Officer and the President\nI don't know, I don't see that. But we have a multiple design wins that are ramping. And so I don't believe there will be any particular pattern of shipments and so forth other than maybe what we experienced in the past. I think some of the designs will balance with each other in terms of the demand and the pull in.\nSo I think it will be I would expect a similar ramp and the similar demand that we've seen in the past. I think volume-wise, for us, we expect, as we said, we expect to continue to gain share over time. We have been doing it, as you can validate with the growth rates we have reported quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year. Obviously, we are growing much faster than market, much, much faster than that.\nSo we expect that, that is an indication of a share gain, and we continue to do that.\nMary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer\nLet me just add to that before we finish up, and Mark, I'll give you your follow-up. But at least for the last two years for our company, maybe for all the years we've shipped, the 12/31 quarter has consistently been stronger than 9/30. So that's what made Q3 and Q4 3/31 and 6/30 being higher than the 12/31 kind of remarkable. But generally speaking, we have not actually seen all the shipments going out in 9/30 quarter.\nSorry, Mark, go ahead.\nMark Miller -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst\nLast question for me is ROADM, I assume that was strong. Any color on that?\nMary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer\nSo yes, so go ahead, Giovanni.\nGiovanni Barbarossa -- Chief Strategy Officer and the President\nYes. Yes, absolutely. ROADM is an integral part of out in traffic at the fiscal layer, as you know. And as I said, the new network architectures out there that require way more flexibility to provision traffic at the right place at the right time, really increased the demand for the kind of products versus the previous network architecture.\nSo it has been very strong for us.\nMark Miller -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you.

So we see that same opportunity and it can be upside for us as we see the China move into 5G accelerate.\nGary Mobley -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\nOK. As my follow-up, I wanted to -- I want to ask you about content growth at your lead customer, but I know you won't go there. But I was hoping maybe you can give us a little more detail on sort of the frequency band support that will be needed as we move from one 5G phone to the next generation. In other words, the cycles within the cycle, so to speak, as it relates to their interfaces.\nWhat sort of content growth do you think you can see long term and broad market related as these flagship phones need to support more frequency bands, in particular, things like millimeter wave support. And then, related to that, perhaps what your current stance is with respect to millimeter wave?\nLiam Griffin -- Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President\nSure. Well, I mean, as you've seen, the frequency opportunities continue to expand. If you look at the C-band auction, for example, that opened up a tremendous amount of technology, three to six gig, where we can capitalize immediately. I think the appetite -- if we go high level, the appetite for this technology is really strong, right? The mobile technology that we see every year gets more complex, more challenging, whether it's in China, whether it's in the US, and we love that because we're a company that focuses on the high end, we focus on technology, we focus on excellence in our products and we see that opportunity be rewarded with our customers.\nSo we can hit all of those nodes, whether it's a China play, whether it's the high end of the US, and we've grown the technology along with it. So that's how we go to market. There's nothing new about the news around Huawei or anything like that, all that stuff is completely understood. Millimeter wave, you mentioned.\nMillimeter wave is an interesting technology. It works in certain areas. It has some drawbacks as well that are well known. And we listen to our customers, and we have great engagement with all the players that we need to work with.\nAnd together, we resolve the complexity and work on the end market solution. So we have investments across that entire spectrum. We know what we need to do to win. We also know what we need to do to allow our customers to win.\nAnd that's the recipe that's been working.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Sir, your line is open.\nBlayne Curtis -- Barclays Investment Bank -- Analyst\nThanks for taking my question. I just want to revisit the September guide. So I guess when you look at it on an organic basis, it's a little over $100 million sequentially. If you look back last year, your lead customer kind of contributed to that amount.\nAnd with the earlier launch and content gains, we should think it would be more. So just trying to understand, are there some segments that are down? Or are you adding some conservatism?

You can always go market by market and look at various metrics, and you can do -- you can see that there is a significant new infrastructure that needs to be added. New sites need to be added in those markets to be able to support the growth that they have going on in those markets.\nAnd so, as we've always said, as you well know, the international markets are a couple of technologies behind generally. And so -- and without any really strong wireline capability and so on.

We've seen continued growth in the India marketplace from a couple of the large carriers there.\nSo there's an outsized, probably piece of that 500 that is there. And as Rod mentioned, we're getting double-digit rates of return right out of the gate. We're seeing also significant demand in Africa. In Nigeria markets, like Nigeria, Uganda, some of the markets where we're seeing upticks in the overall bill to suit the activity.\nBrazil is a market we've always talked about. It's been indeed probably twice as many sites in the market as they are today.

{"question": "What is the estimated gross margin for Xiamen fab in 2022", "answer": " The estimated gross margin for Xiamen fab in 2022 is not provided in the transcript.", "transcript": " we foresee those structural catalysts will continue to drive, including the 5G transformation, the EV and IoT devices. And those megatrends are still representing significant growth on a year-over-year basis. And we do anticipate those structural drivers will continue to fuel our growth including the OLED driver, the ISP, the WiFi-6, RF switch, MCU, PMIC, and so -- and which also lead to a higher silicon content. So we are convinced that most of those demand surge are here to stay largely driven by those structural needs.\nSo given those catalysts, and we have certain confidence. And -- I mean, in addition to that, based on our efforts and market position, that gives us that confidence that the 2022 will be another strong year for UMC to gain market share.\nCharlie Chan -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nYes. But the consensus for TSMC is like next year to grow 15% to 20%. So do you think you can perform similar or even better than this key foundry peer?\nJason Wang -- Director and President\nOur estimate on the foundry industry growth in 2022 at this point is about 12%.\nCharlie Chan -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\n12%. I'm sorry. Okay.\nJason Wang -- Director and President\n12%. Yes. And for our business outlook, I think we'll be higher than this current foundry industry projection.\nCharlie Chan -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nOkay. And lastly, variable cost. I mean that is a key reason why foundry peers want to hike the price, right? So variable cost no matter percentage or per wafer number. So can Chitung give us some kind of comment about the trend? For example, this year-over-year, what was the growth for the variable cost? And what would be the variable cost growth for the coming two years?\nQi Dong Liu -- Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President, Head of Corporate Governance and Company Secretary\nYes. For the operating expenses, it will be growing along with our enlarged revenue. However, as a percentage of revenue, we hope it will be flat to down, under control. So the revenue growth will outpace the operating expenses. As for raw material like raw wafer and also labors that were also on the rise. But altogether, I think we are commenting that because of our production efficiency improvement, our improved economy of scale, and also with a good outlook for both demand as well as pricing for 2022. I think there's still further upside for our margins -- profit margins.\nCharlie Chan -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nGot you. Thank you that's super helpful. Thanks gentlemen.\nOperator\nThe next question is coming from Roland Shu of Citigroup. Go ahead please.\nRoland Shu -- Citigroup -- Analyst\nGood afternoon. So your Xiamen fab began production from 4Q 2015. It was still loss-making last year, and I think it is still loss-making now. So with the better pricing, when do you expect Xiamen fab is going to be turned around? And also how many margin upside or earning upside to UMC once Xiamen fab is breakeven?\nQi Dong Liu -- Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President, Head of Corporate Governance and Company Secretary\nXiamen should be able to be profitable in 2022. As a matter of fact, they are profitable in single quarters of 2021. So we are very close to breakeven in 2021. And it is expected to be profitable in 2022. However, it will still below corporate average in terms of profit margin in 2022. And there's still room for Xiamen to catch up to the level of UMC's corporate average.\nRoland Shu -- Citigroup -- Analyst\nUnderstood. Yes.

This year's expected 500 million handsets being built with 5G capability, which is about 40% of the total handset market. We expect that to grow in 2022 to something like 65% to 70%, and then the year after it will gradually move to a higher percentage. The overall smartphone market, if you take the overall volume, it grows mid-single digits percentage this year and we expect, let's say, a moderate growth going forward. We saw some of the critical markets like, for example, the India market holding back a bit in the second quarter, but we expect that to recover going forward. So, that's what we see over the next two years, continued growth in 5G. We have a strong footprint there. And that is a strong growth driver for Amkor going forward.\nArthur Winston -- Pilot Advisors -- Analyst\nGood. In terms of capacity utilization, are we bumping up against utilization any place like Korea or someplace where we're fully utilized?\nGiel Rutten -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, we installed significant incremental capacity actually in the second quarter to prepare for the third quarter ramp. Currently, our lines are highly utilized. We see still some utilization improvement possibilities in our Japan factory, for example. But, generally, in the third and fourth quarter, we are close to fully utilized, and we also expect this year to be close to fully yield utilized in the third and fourth quarter.\nArthur Winston -- Pilot Advisors -- Analyst\nWell, OK. Have you picked a location in the United States? And if so, what do you think the whole project will cost when you finished up with it?\nGiel Rutten -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, we're watching closely the activities in the U.S., with establishing semiconductor manufacturing supply chain.

Driven by this market recognition and potential, we expect 2021 to be the breakout year for our XBAR technology. Turning to Slide 4.\nThere's a ton of excitement in the media around the promises of 5G, and understandably so as it will affect every industry and broadly improve many parts of our day-to-day lives. However, I'd like to spend some time clarifying where we are and where we are headed as it relates to the rollout of 5G, as well as the ultrafast next-generation networks such as Wi-Fi and ultrawideband, which are often dependent upon each other and are critical to the connected world we all envision in the future. The improvements in speed and latency with their foundation in power handling at high frequency and wide bandwidth, the next-generation networks require to open the door to massive connectivity between people and things are taking shape on a broader scale. Mobile phones, smart devices, home appliances, connected vehicles, and many more applications are poised to benefit from this real-time communication.\nAnd all of the networks powering these applications need RF filter solutions such as the ones Resonant's XBAR technology enables. While the network operators are working hard to deliver nationwide 5G coverage in its initial form, bringing the very early stages in its performance and capability, we are essentially rounding first base with today's 5G as it's only available in relatively few cities across a limited number of expensive devices that exhibit less than marketed performance. The revolutionary improvements that 5G networks will provide is not yet available. Real 5G data speeds will be 100 times faster than 4G with -- with latency 25 times that of 4G, and this will only be achievable with protection against interference.\nIn January, U.S. mobile network operators spent over $80 billion to acquire new Sub-6 gigahertz RF spectrum, upon which their 5G network services will be built, a new record. This is another indication of our forecast that the second wave of 5G deployment will be in the Sub-6 gigahertz range and it won't be until 5G's third wave for full Millimeter Wave deployment. What this means is in the absence of XBAR technologies being deployed, the market would leverage aluminum nitride BAW, which has shorter range, requiring more base stations to be deployed in the operators' networks, which equals higher cost.\nWe believe there is a potential for billions of dollars of spectrum that could be wasted in the U.S. alone due to interference degrading spectral efficiency or based on the increased number of base stations to deliver the same coverage. 5G will also depend on next-generation networks such as Wi-Fi 6E and ultrawideband, which bring additional capacity and speed, as well as extreme location accuracy. These new networks serve as a backstop to the 5G cellular network, which can easily reach capacity and become overloaded.\nTurning Slide 5. The challenge that exists with these networks is unlike any other in the history of wireless technology. Delivering state of performance to these next-generation networks requires every device to have high-performance RF filters. It's well-documented that the RF filters that were designed for 4G requirements are not technically well-suited and cannot scale to meet the demands of these next-generation networks due to the physics behind the base technology not having the required power handling and bandwidth at high frequencies.\nBut let's take a few minutes to explore what would happen in a world where Resonant's XBAR technology did not exist. The handset OEMs are going to demand that the market's leading providers of RF filters deliver the best solutions they can that can support the standards of 5G operation. Remember, 98% of the RF filter market is controlled by seven companies.

Mobile phones, smart devices, home appliances, connected vehicles, and many more applications are poised to benefit from this real-time communication.\nAnd all of the networks powering these applications need RF filter solutions such as the ones Resonant's XBAR technology enables. While the network operators are working hard to deliver nationwide 5G coverage in its initial form, bringing the very early stages in its performance and capability, we are essentially rounding first base with today's 5G as it's only available in relatively few cities across a limited number of expensive devices that exhibit less than marketed performance. The revolutionary improvements that 5G networks will provide is not yet available. Real 5G data speeds will be 100 times faster than 4G with -- with latency 25 times that of 4G, and this will only be achievable with protection against interference.\nIn January, U.S. mobile network operators spent over $80 billion to acquire new Sub-6 gigahertz RF spectrum, upon which their 5G network services will be built, a new record. This is another indication of our forecast that the second wave of 5G deployment will be in the Sub-6 gigahertz range and it won't be until 5G's third wave for full Millimeter Wave deployment. What this means is in the absence of XBAR technologies being deployed, the market would leverage aluminum nitride BAW, which has shorter range, requiring more base stations to be deployed in the operators' networks, which equals higher cost.\nWe believe there is a potential for billions of dollars of spectrum that could be wasted in the U.S. alone due to interference degrading spectral efficiency or based on the increased number of base stations to deliver the same coverage. 5G will also depend on next-generation networks such as Wi-Fi 6E and ultrawideband, which bring additional capacity and speed, as well as extreme location accuracy. These new networks serve as a backstop to the 5G cellular network, which can easily reach capacity and become overloaded.\nTurning Slide 5. The challenge that exists with these networks is unlike any other in the history of wireless technology. Delivering state of performance to these next-generation networks requires every device to have high-performance RF filters. It's well-documented that the RF filters that were designed for 4G requirements are not technically well-suited and cannot scale to meet the demands of these next-generation networks due to the physics behind the base technology not having the required power handling and bandwidth at high frequencies.\nBut let's take a few minutes to explore what would happen in a world where Resonant's XBAR technology did not exist.

Looking at how well our overall strategy is performing, since 2017, we have increased our consolidated return on invested capital by 160 basis points to 9.5% and returned over $10 billion to shareholders through our dividend that has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 9%, while also investing $7 billion of capital into attractive assets we believe will generate returns well in excess of our cost of capital and contributed to dividend growth in the future. I believe that the combination highlights how compelling and differentiated our strategy is.\nWe provide investors with the most exposure to the development of next generation that works with our comprehensive offering of towers, small cells, and fiber, a pure play U.S. wireless infrastructure provider with exposure to the best growth and the lowest risk market, a compelling total return profile with a current yield of nearly 5%, and a long-term annual dividend growth target of 7% to 8% and the development of attractive new assets that we believe will extend our runway of growth and shareholder value creation. In the context of our 6.5% dividend per share growth this year, it is remarkable to consider that the underlay -- to consider the underlying strength of our business can absorb the significant headwinds of interest expense increases, and Sprint cancellations in the near term without disrupting the long-term growth of the business. I believe this durability of the underlying demand trends we see in the U.S.\nthat provides significant visibility into the anticipated future growth of our business, the deliberate decisions we have made to reduce the risks associated with our strategy, and our history of steady execution makes Crown Castle an excellent investment that will generate compelling returns over time.

So first of all, our Edge and Access piece, our next generation metro included in that, 5G is one driver there, also the evolution of an enterprise business services in general is another driver. I think we've talked in the past around our existing businesses, very strong in those areas, wireless backhaul and enterprise services in North America and India, I'll just say under distributed in the rest of the world, partially because historically it was not playing in the IP space. The investments that we're making there is really around our next generation IP capability with a ground-up IP OS integrated with our optics, integrated with our multilayer domain controllers, and then a series of products optimized for things like 5G, fiber deep and the next generation sort of aggregation networks for converged traffic.\nAll of those things we think is an opportunity that will show up in our Metro and our Packet business, and we expect that to grow faster than our aggregate part of the business going forward.\nNow, 5G specifically, I think what's going on right now is sort of augmentation on their existing architectures, that will benefit us where we have wireless backhaul instalments today, but our real opportunity longer term is as they start to look at stand-alone architectures and make architectural decisions, that will allow us to expand our addressable market beyond our historical installed base of wireless backhaul.\nSamik Chatterjee -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\nGot it. And if I can follow-up with a question for Jim, just if you can give us some color on, you talked about the investments that are kind of probably going to be elevated for a bit here.

The global pandemic highlighted the impact connectivity has on our lives and acted as a catalyst for rapid change toward digital transformation. This presents a unique set of opportunities for CEVA differentiated technologies and operational agility, in particular in four key markets: 5G RAN, Wi-Fi, TWS earbuds and automotive.\nLet me take the next few minutes to elaborate on these growth drivers and the anchors CEVA has already in place in these lucrative markets. 5G RAN. 5G offers data rates and ubiquitous connectivity. The fast rollout of 5G networks to-date is predominantly aimed at smartphone use cases. According to Ericsson's most recent Mobility Report, by the end of 2020, over $1 billion or 15% of the world's population live in a 5G coverage area. China in particular is very advanced with 70% of the global 5G connections according to the GSM Association. Beyond smartphones, 5G offers new growth opportunities in regards to URLLC and IoT applications. These applications will be at the center of next-generation technology deployments in industrial, robotics, AR and autonomous cars.\nThe digital transformation, and the new applications 5G enables, present sizable opportunities for CEVA's 5G RAN technologies beyond our existing incumbency in baseband. This specifically applies to the growing use of Active Antennas, a new antenna technology that combines arrays of antennas with DSP to process complex algorithms such as massive MIMO and beamforming for more precise steering of the antenna signal which gains a substantial boost in capacity and energy efficiencies. The emergence of O-RAN and vRAN which aims to transform the telecom industry from relying on proprietary platforms from a limited number of OEM to a disaggregate network with open interfaces and a multitude of merchant chips from incumbent and new suppliers. Rethink Research is expecting Open RAN to account for 58% of the overall RAN capex spending by 2026.\nWith our second-to-none competitive edge in DSP processors, we are able to empower our existing and upcoming customers to innovate and quickly expand their market reach to the remote radio units and address new opportunities in the RAN space like private networks, small cells, Fixed Wireless Access and O-RAN. We are encouraged by the progress ZTE has made in the 5G RAN space, growing its share in the global RAN market from 8% to 11% on a year-over-year basis, according to Dell'Oro, and we expect other customers of ours to go into production in 2021.\nWi-Fi, Wi-Fi is deployed in over 5 billion smartphones and more than 300 million hotspots today. Cisco estimates that more than 50% of the global mobile data traffic is offloaded to Wi-Fi, and this is set to grow to over 70%.

In addition, as I noted earlier, Wi-Fi 6 along with our Bluetooth technologies bring us opportunities to penetrate the high volume market of smartphones as more OEMs are looking to internalize wireless connectivity technologies, as well as semis that look to take advantage of our leadership in the Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth domains.\nTWS earbuds, The TWS earbuds market pre", "date": "Feb 16, 2021, 8:30 a.m. ET", "ticker": "CEVA", "quarter": "2020-Q4", "predictions": [{"class_id": 0, "class_name": "correct", "prob": 0.7643154528229519}, {"class_id": 1, "class_name": "incorrect", "prob": 0.23568454717704806}]}
{"question": "What was the percentage increase in the number of global 5G connections in 2020 compared to the previous year", "answer": " The percentage increase in the number of global 5G connections in 2020 compared to the previous year was 15%.", "transcript": "27% year-over-year to more than 1.3 billion units, with a record 750 million units from our base station and IoT customers.\nIn perspective, 2020 was a landmark year for both CEVA and its industries. The global pandemic highlighted the impact connectivity has on our lives and acted as a catalyst for rapid change toward digital transformation. This presents a unique set of opportunities for CEVA differentiated technologies and operational agility, in particular in four key markets: 5G RAN, Wi-Fi, TWS earbuds and automotive.\nLet me take the next few minutes to elaborate on these growth drivers and the anchors CEVA has already in place in these lucrative markets. 5G RAN. 5G offers data rates and ubiquitous connectivity. The fast rollout of 5G networks to-date is predominantly aimed at smartphone use cases. According to Ericsson's most recent Mobility Report, by the end of 2020, over $1 billion or 15% of the world's population live in a 5G coverage area. China in particular is very advanced with 70% of the global 5G connections according to the GSM Association. Beyond smartphones, 5G offers new growth opportunities in regards to URLLC and IoT applications. These applications will be at the center of next-generation technology deployments in industrial, robotics, AR and autonomous cars.\nThe digital transformation, and the new applications 5G enables, present sizable opportunities for CEVA's 5G RAN technologies beyond our existing incumbency in baseband. This specifically applies to the growing use of Active Antennas, a new antenna technology that combines arrays of antennas with DSP to process complex algorithms such as massive MIMO and beamforming for more precise steering of the antenna signal which gains a substantial boost in capacity and energy efficiencies. The emergence of O-RAN and vRAN which aims to transform the telecom industry from relying on proprietary platforms from a limited number of OEM to a disaggregate network with open interfaces and a multitude of merchant chips from incumbent and new suppliers. Rethink Research is expecting Open RAN to account for 58% of the overall RAN capex spending by 2026.\nWith our second-to-none competitive edge in DSP processors, we are able to empower our existing and upcoming customers to innovate and quickly expand their market reach to the remote radio units and address new opportunities in the RAN space like private networks, small cells, Fixed Wireless Access and O-RAN. We are encouraged by the progress ZTE has made in the 5G RAN space, growing its share in the global RAN market from 8% to 11% on a year-over-year basis, according to Dell'Oro, and we expect other customers of ours to go into production in 2021.\nWi-Fi, Wi-Fi is deployed in over 5 billion smartphones and more than 300 million hotspots today. Cisco estimates that more than 50% of the global mobile data traffic is offloaded to Wi-Fi, and this is set to grow to over 70%. AT&T noted that its network experienced 90% Wi-Fi data growth during the pandemic. The new Wi-Fi standards, Wi-Fi 6 and 6E, provide substantially higher data rates of up to 9.6 giga bit per second versus 1.3 giga bit per second in the prior generation, Wi-Fi 5. Wi-Fi 6 also presents sizable opportunities beyond smartphones and PCs, through the proliferation of connected IoT devices such as smart home appliances, smart TVs, smart speakers, connected cars and wearables.\nOur RivieraWaves Wi-Fi 6 IP is at the forefront of the Wi-Fi 6 upgrade cycle and the only IP with successive record of accomplishment. We have signed to date more than 10 Wi-Fi 6 customers, and our existing Wi-Fi 4 and Wi-Fi 5 customer shipments grew more than six-fold in 2020, the start of a significant expected ramp up.

It was evenly spread among the three months within the quarter. And, of course, now in June, we are going through our slowest seasonal quarter, so somewhere in the middle of the quarter, you hit the bottom, and then you start ramping up toward the second half of the calendar year where, again, we're very bullish about the opportunity there to produce strong sequential growth into September and December.\nRaji Gill -- Needham & Company -- Analyst\nAnd, Liam, you mentioned your integrated modular approach, they're particularly giving you an advantage.

Ron, I'm just kind of curious, with the recent C-band auctions in the U.S. now behind us, can you help me better understand how that kind of impacts your view on your comms business as we go throughout the balance of this year? And as you do that, I'd be kind of curious as to the sort of geographic distribution specifically.\nAs you think about next quarter and beyond, how much more important is China? Or are you actually starting to see things percolate in the U.S. and beyond?\nSatish Dhanasekaran -- Chief Operating Officer\nYeah, John, you know, it's a good question. With regard to the deployment scenarios globally, you know, as we all know, China started to lead the 5G deployments. And with the C-band auction coming in, the major announcements from the U.S. operator referencing a road map to deploy more 5G in the country, we view it as a positive.\nWe saw an uptick of our -- in our business in the U.S., specifically for capabilities in the C-band this quarter, and we view the funnel and pipeline to be strong there. But again, not to get too siloed on one spectrum, because at the end of the day, our customers are looking to test for creating devices and products that cater to the global marketplace.

And then with 6G coming in with terahertz, so there is a big long-term road map that's playing out. Specific to your question on 5G, maybe I can offer a data point.\nIf you think of the certification being a critical parameter for 5G devices, about 150 devices are being certified right now. About 30% of them have millimeter wave in it. So, you know, that paints the picture, hopefully. And the total number of 5G devices right now that are being released is about 700.\nSo it sort of gives you maybe a framing on where we are.

I just wanted to follow up on the last question, particularly around the supply chain issues that have been impacting companies industrywide. I guess just a clarification on my part.\nYou know, in this quarter, did you see an impact from supply issues on your top line and margins? And if so, what was the impact -- can you quantify the impact? And then relative to the guidance, are you guys baking in any headwind, material headwinds on the top line, or margins? Thank you.\nRon Nersesian -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nHi, this is Ron. As you know, in the last quarter, we exceeded our revenue guidance. And you've seen our guide for the next quarter, very pleased with the performance and how we've been able to deliver the revenue despite what's going on in the world. Of course, we see some COVID manufacturing decreases in capacity, as well as some supply chain components shortages.\nHowever, we planned ahead. We fought for those. And the most important part is that when you look at custom ICs, which have a very, very long lead time for many folks in the industry, we have an on-site fab that creates and produces all of our custom ICs. So that enables us to basically have complete control of that supply chain for the critical custom parts.\nWe're very confident in the guide that we have. But there's no doubt that we have built backlog and our order book is strong.

Over the last quarter, we ran a comprehensive process to find a Chinese investment partner. I'm very proud and excited to say that the process concluded with Goertek a proven success story in China. Goertek is a high-volume supplier of semiconductor components, modules and assembled products to the most demanding, smartphone OEMs and service providers worldwide.\nOver the last 10 years, they've grown revenue from around $100 million, peaking at over $4 billion growing at over a 40% compound rate during that period. Our 5G GaN on silicon opportunity fits Goertek's operating model perfectly. They source proprietary semiconductor products and technology from industry leaders like TI, Broadcom and Infineon.

However, the transcript does mention that the dominant trend is companies in China increasingly adopting infrastructure in the cloud, platform in the cloud and software in the cloud, and this trend is expected to continue. The transcript also mentions that in 2020, there was a high degree of uncertainty in the technology industry in China about the ability to continue purchasing servers and GPUs and smart NIC cards and this caused some stockpiling, which has now been unwound.", "transcript": "ask your question.\u00a0\nJohn Choi -- Daiwa Capital Markets -- Analyst\nThanks for taking my question. Just quickly, two questions here. On cloud computing, I understand that we had a pretty healthy growth. But right now, as the overall macro is kind of slowing down, we've been seeing some -- a little bit of delay of so-called the capex or IT budget being deployed.\nAre we likely seeing any of that? Or as we look into 2022, is the growth trend still intact? And secondly, just a quick follow-up on your international game strategy. If we look into your -- I mean, clearly, we've been doing a great job but mostly from a mobile standpoint of view. But if we extend our platform, particularly in console or more on the PC side, on the more of the casual, what is our strategy there? And should we be expecting more strategic investments or M&A and decide to acquire more IP? Thank you.\nJames Mitchell -- Chief Strategy Officer\nSo on the cloud question, our view is that the dominant trend is companies in China increasingly adopting infrastructure in the cloud, platform in the cloud and software in the cloud, and we think that trend continues with or without a faster or slower macroeconomic environment. Specifically on the point of CapEx bouncing around, I think that's true and I think that reflects the fact that in 2020, there was a high degree of uncertainty in the technology industry in China about the ability to continue purchasing servers and GPUs and smart NIC cards and so forth. And that caused some stockpiling, which I think has now been unwound. And the global supply chain seems to be moving to a more normal basis, at least from a sort of a regulatory perspective vis-a-vis the United States.\nSo I'd say, at this point in time, we think that Business Services will be less affected by regulation and macro fluctuation than Advertising. And then your question around console and PC, I wasn't sure I caught the nuance. I mean, obviously, we've been creating PC games for many years, more recently as the x86 architecture has converged between PC and console. We've started releasing games on console as well, including Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon UNITE most recently.\nAnd if you look at a number of what we refer to as sort of genre-leading specialty studios outside China, then the majority of them are actually console- and PC-centric, and they've developed a reputation and a reality for operating particularly good games within a particular genre on console and PC, and we're now supporting them to do that at bigger scale than before. In terms of IP, then generally speaking, IP matters more to mobile and perhaps a little bit less of PC outside China. The non-China PC gaming audience is a relatively engaged sophisticated audience that looks at reviews on Steam and Epic Game store and collects feedback from other players. And so what you can often see situations where our development team who works on one particular IP very successfully actually separate from that IP and create something else that is a brand-new IP but ends up being bigger and better.\nAnd stereotypically -- or classic example, the Epic Games where for a decade, they were associated exclusively with the Gears of War IP, but subsequently, they sold Gears of War and they focused on creating the Fortnite IP, which is even bigger and better than Gears of War.\nOperator\nThank you.

And the global supply chain seems to be moving to a more normal basis, at least from a sort of a regulatory perspective vis-a-vis the United States.\nSo I'd say, at this point in time, we think that Business Services will be less affected by regulation and macro fluctuation than Advertising. And then your question around console and PC, I wasn't sure I caught the nuance. I mean, obviously, we've been creating PC games for many years, more recently as the x86 architecture has converged between PC and console. We've started releasing games on console as well, including Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon UNITE most recently.\nAnd if you look at a number of what we refer to as sort of genre-leading specialty studios outside China, then the majority of them are actually console- and PC-centric, and they've developed a reputation and a reality for operating particularly good games within a particular genre on console and PC, and we're now supporting them to do that at bigger scale than before. In terms of IP, then generally speaking, IP matters more to mobile and perhaps a little bit less of PC outside China. The non-China PC gaming audience is a relatively engaged sophisticated audience that looks at reviews on Steam and Epic Game store and collects feedback from other players. And so what you can often see situations where our development team who works on one particular IP very successfully actually separate from that IP and create something else that is a brand-new IP but ends up being bigger and better.\nAnd stereotypically -- or classic example, the Epic Games where for a decade, they were associated exclusively with the Gears of War IP, but subsequently, they sold Gears of War and they focused on creating the Fortnite IP, which is even bigger and better than Gears of War.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from Alicia Yap from Citigroup. Please ask your question.\nAlicia Yap\nHi. Good evening, management. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two questions.\nThe first one is regarding your new versions of the CRM, SaaS, CDN. It seems like you will be launching a new version by the end of this year to provide a deeper integration with -- between the Tencent Meeting and also the WeCom. So how should we think about this upcoming online advertising opportunity within WeChat that could further expand and penetrate into other traditional industry vertical? And then second question, I guess, is there's a lot of Metaverse question tonight.

{"question": "What was the revenue growth rate for Tencent's business services business in 2021-Q3 compared to the same period in 2020", "answer": " I do not have access to the specific revenue growth rate for Tencent's business services business in 2021-Q3 compared to the same period in 2020. However, the transcript does mention that the dominant trend is companies in China increasingly adopting infrastructure in the cloud, platform in the cloud and software in the cloud, and this trend is expected to continue. Additionally, the transcript mentions that Business Services will be less affected by regulation and macro fluctuation than Advertising.", "transcript": "ask your question.\u00a0\nJohn Choi -- Daiwa Capital Markets -- Analyst\nThanks for taking my question. Just quickly, two questions here. On cloud computing, I understand that we had a pretty healthy growth. But right now, as the overall macro is kind of slowing down, we've been seeing some -- a little bit of delay of so-called the capex or IT budget being deployed.\nAre we likely seeing any of that? Or as we look into 2022, is the growth trend still intact? And secondly, just a quick follow-up on your international game strategy. If we look into your -- I mean, clearly, we've been doing a great job but mostly from a mobile standpoint of view. But if we extend our platform, particularly in console or more on the PC side, on the more of the casual, what is our strategy there? And should we be expecting more strategic investments or M&A and decide to acquire more IP? Thank you.\nJames Mitchell -- Chief Strategy Officer\nSo on the cloud question, our view is that the dominant trend is companies in China increasingly adopting infrastructure in the cloud, platform in the cloud and software in the cloud, and we think that trend continues with or without a faster or slower macroeconomic environment. Specifically on the point of CapEx bouncing around, I think that's true and I think that reflects the fact that in 2020, there was a high degree of uncertainty in the technology industry in China about the ability to continue purchasing servers and GPUs and smart NIC cards and so forth.

So we do see continuous growth in content, but the content is getting harder.\nIt's not more things. It's more complex things. And so, you need to have an architect that could bring this together and make it easier for our customers to assimilate. That's what we do.\nSo every year, it's not just phone to phone, the phone -- the technology and the complexity within the device is rising. And that, for us, is very, very good, and it limits the competition, and it puts us in a great position to delight the customer. So we look forward to that. And overall, 5G penetration at a high level is still very low right now globally.\nThere's a lot of room to move from here. And there's a lot of upgrades that haven't yet commenced.

Well, I mean, in general terms, the ability to get that demand through has been impeded, right. We discussed through the call today. I would say that Skyworks uniquely, with our own fabs, our own assembly and test and assets, we're a manufacturer, as well as a developer of technology.\nSo we should be able to do better than peers that are more fabless. But at the same time, we're all dealing with this global chip shortage as we say. And so, that is an impediment to demand. We talked a bit about that, and hopefully, that can be unstuck to some level, but we are working with our customers closely.\nWe're doing a -- our teams are working very hard to resolve any impediments in demand execution. And we certainly think that it will abate over time, but it does play through in the current quarter and into the second half of it.\nKevin Cassidy -- Rosenblatt Securities -- Analyst\nOK. Great. And just to make sure I understand that. So if your customer isn't getting the full bill of material, they're asking to hold up deliveries, they're not building inventory of your product waiting for other products?\nLiam Griffin -- Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President\nYes, somewhat that's true. It just depends on how it's going. Sometimes our parts are ready, and we're not holding anybody up, but someone else is holding us up, right? So it's kind of a -- everything has to be complete for an end product to ship. So anything in the food chain that goes sour, it could be an impediment.\nBut I think we'll navigate our part and we do see some -- the cloud is kind of clearing here in the next couple of few quarters and we should benefit from that.\nKevin Cassidy -- Rosenblatt Securities -- Analyst\nOK, great.

{"question": "What was the net revenue for the fourth quarter of 2020 ", "answer": " The net revenue for the fourth quarter of 2020 was RMB 1.89 billion.", "transcript": "nsion from terminal sales to user operations. All of this product and technology innovation, IoT experience, as well as the service optimization are the key drivers of our long-term development. The construction of China's 5G infrastructure has demonstrated rapid development. An era of the commercial application of IoT is on the way.\nAccording to data released by IDC, 85% of devices will be connected to the Internet and 15% will be connected to IoT by 2022. It was pointed out in the guidelines for construction of the National AI Standards System, launched by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and other national official departments in last July that smart home product and application will be promoted as one of the important industries in this area. We believe that with the rapid application of 5G and the continuous improvement of smart home ecology, IoT will be applied in more and more home scenarios. We are confident in our leading position in this industry, as well as our capabilities to deliver robust and stable growth while maintaining a healthy level of profitability, bringing long-term value to our shareholders.\nThat concludes our founder's remarks. Let's now turn to the detailed financial review of the fourth-quarter 2020, as well as the outlook for the first-quarter 2021. The net revenues were RMB 1.89 billion, representing year-over-year increase of 8.5%. The growth was slightly below our previous guidance by just around 0.6% primarily due to the proactive step to stop the sales of some specific products with lower average selling prices and lower gross margins, such as some low-end refrigerators and washing machines, in order to make room for the launch of a slate of new large-screen refrigerators and high-end washing machines, as well as to improve the profitability.\nRevenues from IoT @ Home portfolio increased by 15.7% to RMB 1.11 billion from RMB 963.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2019, primarily driven by the sustained sales increase for certain new product categories, in particular, our sweeper robots. Viomi-branded sweeper robot business is expected to make greater contribution in 2021. Revenues from our home water solutions decreased by 5.9% to RMB 363 million. The decline was primarily due to the decreases in the average selling prices of our Xiaomi-branded water purifiers products.\nThis was partially offset by the successful introduction and increased sales of our new series of Viomi-branded water purifier products, which narrowed the year-over-year decline for home water solutions compared to the previous quarter. Viomi-branded water purifiers are expected to make greater contribution in our home water solution business, as well as our total net revenues in 2021. Revenues from consumables increased by 69.3% to RMB 160.2 million primarily due to increased demand for our water purifier filter products. Revenues from small appliances and others decreased by 15.5% to RMB 251.2 million primarily due to product portfolio optimization for higher gross margin in this category.\nGross profit increased by 28% to RMB 443.8 million, and gross margin was 23.5% compared to 17.1% for the third quarter of last year and 19.9% for the fourth quarter of 2019. The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increases in gross margin were primarily driven by our efforts to shift the business and product mix toward higher gross margin products, including the rollout of our new Viomi-branded water purifiers and sweeper robots, alongside the optimization of margins across product lines. As Mr. Chen discussed, the meaningful recovery in gross margin was in line with our quality growth strategy, demonstrating our business flexibility and strong execution capabilities.\nAs we continue to phase out our lower-margin products and focus our efforts on generating greater revenue contribution from higher-margin product categories and SKUs, we do expect to experience not full degree of gross margin recovery in 2021. The total operating expenses increased by 21.3% to RMB 331.8 million primarily due to the growth of our ", "date": "Mar 25, 2021, 8:00 a.m. ET", "ticker": "VIOT", "quarter": "2020-Q4", "predictions": [{"class_id": 0, "class_name": "correct", "prob": 0.7623853753728198}, {"class_id": 1, "class_name": "incorrect", "prob": 0.23761462462718025}]}
